# Flipbook Portfolio

Welcome to **Flipbook Portfolio**!  
This is my first custom-made portfolio website, designed with unique flipbook visuals to showcase my creative work and web development projects. The site is built primarily using **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**, bringing interactive and visually compelling navigation that mimics the flipping of a book.

## ✨ Features

- **Flipbook Navigation**: Experience a seamless and interactive book-flipping animation for browsing through sections.

- **Custom Animations**: Handcrafted CSS and JavaScript animations for unique user interactions.
- **Project Gallery**: Organized showcase of my best work and collaborations.
- **Contact Form**: Simple way for visitors to reach out and connect.
